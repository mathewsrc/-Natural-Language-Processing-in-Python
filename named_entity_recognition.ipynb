              "\"The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced  no evidencethat any irregularities took placeThe jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election ,  deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlantafor the manner in which the election was conductedThe September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularitiesin the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. Only a relative handful of such reports was received, the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city. The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous. It recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them. The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments. Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration. The City Purchasing Department , the jury said ,  is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies. It urged that the city  take steps to remedythis problemImplementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing juryIt urged that the next Legislature  provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected. The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program, the jury said , but the State Welfare Department  has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this moneyThe jurors said they realize  a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties. Nevertheless ,  we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds, the jurors said Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burdenon Fulton taxpayersThe jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensationWards protected The jury said it found the court  has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendationsof two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms, the jury saidRegarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended  that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences. The jury did not elaborate , but it added that  there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable. Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and  a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail. ( 2 ) Fulton legislators  work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitablepension plan for city employesThe jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health DepartmentMayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court FridayHis petition charged mental crueltyThe couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of GriffinAttorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed uponThe petition listed the mayor's occupation as  attorneyand his age as 71It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala.The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a yearThe Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. AjHenry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorneyHartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelectionGeorgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said WednesdayRobert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audienceState Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speakerIn the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered votersDespite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attendedWhen the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissentsThe largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platformSam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaignCaldwell's resignation had been expected for some timeHe will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three yearsWhen the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for ByrdThe Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortlyBefore adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be madeGov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournmentVandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority itemConstruction bonds Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bondsThe bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highwaysA Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction workA revolving fund The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authoritiesVandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin GriffinThe Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bondsSchley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowancesPelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the  quickievote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be soughtWhile emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the actionPelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessionsA veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the pastRep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to  endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expendedas state fundsBarber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there  are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed. But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolutionThe resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read MondayIt says that  in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds, the State Board of Education should be directed to  give priorityto teacher pay raisesColquitt -- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the  coolest election I ever saw in this county. The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive CommitteeDavis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw, Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said Being at the polls was just like being at churchI didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble. The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , howeverIt was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violenceThe former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school boardDuring the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone callsOrdinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the electionMany local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly electionSheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise Everything went real smooth, the sheriff said There wasn't a bit of trouble. Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's  abandoned propertyact seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankersDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and TaxationUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one weekBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of itDaniel termed  extremely conservativehis estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic. It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or moreThe bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurerThe escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declaredDewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy, he said You take out of circulation many millions of dollars. Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount  to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies. His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of AustinCox argued that the bill is  probably unconstitutionalsince , he said , it would impair contractsHe also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last MondayAustin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest countiesThe bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the stateThere was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the HouseIt would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf hereOperating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the SenateThe TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf schoolDallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe RatcliffWhile details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting, said Ratcliff But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it alsoI'm willing to stake my political career on it. Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the poniesA House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding laterThe house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to citiesThe senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendarOne validated acts of school districtsAnother enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation DistrictThe third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adoptedWithout dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast districtMoney for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a siteTwo tax revision bills were passedOne , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarizedInstead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fineIt was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research LeagueThe other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bondsNatural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gasMarshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special electionsUnder Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme CourtAustin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to payAn adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senatorRep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the billThe West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts saidOpponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choiceAll Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absentAustin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities ThursdayRep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 peopleWhen the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of DallasMost of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. ParkhouseThe bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water projectCotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural TexasStatements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attackThe bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs This is a poor boy's bill, said Chapman Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bondsThis would help the little peanut districts.

Chester O. StricklandState and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a  blue ribboncitizens committee on the aid to dependent children programThe report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case loadThe report called racial discrimination in employment  one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency.  Must solve problemThe monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence, Martin saidThe volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of colorThese , he said , are  two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC. Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unityResearch projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacySeveral defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterdayThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trialBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trialBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroomFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client, Bellows told the court Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen propertyIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others. Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired ,  You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this? ?  Yes , your honor, replied Bellows What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this caseThere is a conflict among the defendants. Washington , July 24 -- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radioThe President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephoneShortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had  quite a way to gotoward completionDecisions are made Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied ,  I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts. Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the cityThe last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence  by unfair and fundamentally illegal means. Karns said that the cases involved a matter  of even greater significance than the guilt or innocenceof the 50 personsHe said evidence was obtained  in violation of the legal rights of citizens. Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 casesIn the two other cases he ruled that the state had been  unable to make a case. Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutorIssue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand juryMayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidationWexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioningKarns said it was a  wrongful actfor Wexler to take statements  privately and outside of the grand jury room. He said this constituted a  very serious misuseof the Criminal court processes Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court, said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County courtFaced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 personsWexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with  complementarymiscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to anotherThe cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d wardThe case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by KarnsTwo other cases also were under advisementClaims precedent lacking After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss themWashington , Feb. 9 -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programsThe President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical researchThe aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hillIt was defeated in Congress last yearCost up to $37 a year It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxesThe social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per yearThe Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent eachSimilar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement systemThe payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costsOutlays would increase Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963Both figures would go higher in later yearsOther parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 yearsThese would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxesNursing home care The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days2 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospitalA patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a  unit formulaallowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit3 Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient4 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illnessThe President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy agedCalls proposal modest He said his plan is designed to  meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay.  This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs, he said ,  and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals This is not a program of socialized medicineIt is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteedEvery person will choose his own doctor and hospital. Wouldn't pay doctors The plan does not cover doctor billsThey would still be paid by the patientApart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schoolsThe President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health careMoreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costsContributions to schools The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year studentsThe schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per studentIn addition , the government would pay a $1,000  cost of educationgrant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grantsOfficials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966The President recommended federal  matching grantstotaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing onesMore for nursing homes In the area of  community health services, the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home constructionHe asked for another 10 million dollar  initialappropriation for  stimulatory grantsto states to improve nursing homesHe further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitalsIn the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureauHe also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health instituteAsks research funds The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitationHe did not say by how muchFor medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilitiesThe President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicineThe President said his proposals combine the  indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them. Reaction as expected Congressional reaction to the message was along expected linesLegislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's planThose who backed a similar plan last year hailed the messageSenate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insuranceHalleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial firstHouse Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program  a mighty fine thing, but made no prediction on its fate in the HouseWashington , Feb. 9 -- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chiefOnly 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record voteA number of scattered  ayesand  noeswas heardCustomary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agencyIn the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floorEnforce by demand The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetingsThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changesIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problemsThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialistpowers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problemsThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absenceExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tensionThe general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the councilThere should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advanceCanada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotiveEven Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO lineOn the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped forOne diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as  inconclusive. But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policyExploratory mood A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accreditedThe impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spotsThe Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four monthsBut where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance ,  cornerstoneof its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European watersThe Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a wholeConflict surveyed The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connectionThe annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrentThis increase in the  threshold, as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to comeEach ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilledWashington The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first timeThere is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in LaosThe United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet NamThey count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve thisThe United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominatedBut it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibilityPolicies modified The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conferenceThis is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to makeIt excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administrationIts spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areasBut with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet UnionHe was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatoryGOP restrained It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see itThey can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made  amateurish and monumental blundersin CubaOne Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this scoreHis reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country nowBut he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies firstThe Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist dominationKennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educatorsDetente urged This group pleads with the administration to  give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups. It recommends that the United States  seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds. Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocationBut he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be toleratedUntil the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professorsAid plans revamped Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administrationStrenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statementsPolicies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changedBut thus far there has been no response in kindForeign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nationsIn Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gestureAgain and again it asked the Communists to  freezethe military situation in LaosBut the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rateAnd after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a  great serviceand laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty OrganizationSEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in LaosBut the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however) There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet NamThe administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized LaosThe pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma  neutralistgovernment , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao ArmyThere certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hiltIf the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish themOne factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeHe declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by  encouraging the removalof Prince SouvannaWashington The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United StatesThe President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the  vitality of the nation. In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problemsThe President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trendOffenses multiply The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts  in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problemSimultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth CrimeHis sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offendersAmong arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of ageEast Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believesMr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locallyto outline his proposal at the earliest possible timeEast Providence now has no civil defense programMr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine yearsHe is not interested in being named a full-time directorNoting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local directorHe expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costsMr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD jobOne of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he saidAlong with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralizedMr. Hawksley saidOne advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense programMatching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he saidMr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire StationHe would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford areaSpeaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attackThe Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be anotherRiverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly pointMr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attackSuch vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to knowIf the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locallyOne of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aidOther steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal governmentRhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mindGovernor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General AssemblyThe governor's move into the so-called  blue lawcontroversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central FallsA copy was released to the pressMr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss GrantThe resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislatureWhile the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get  the benefit of his views. He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings, Mr. Notte said ,  to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws. The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time  with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales. The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue lawsShould there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situationThere has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales lawsThe statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the SabbathThe Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on SundayThe only day they  have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday, the council's resolution saidThe small shops  must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community, according to the resolution , which added that they  also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors. It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide  great revenueto the local governmentThe council advised the governor that  large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do businesson SundayThey  operate on a volume basis, it was contended ,  and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community. Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterdayMr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the  welfaretype of government and the other half want a free enterprise systemHe suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election dayHe said he was  confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910. That , he added , was when he was  a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade That was before I studied lawSome of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist PartyThe lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist trackHe steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track. He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resourcesHe suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major partiesMr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said ,  Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it. He said he favors wage increases for workers --  but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze-- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he addedIndicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said :  A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own. Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counselingA petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the townWilliam A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr.The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that postMr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 daysHe explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its workA difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handledMr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called insteadMr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both proceduresHe assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possibleMr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movementHe said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it, he declared It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement. He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement, he indicated ,  and to tell them what this will mean for the town. He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in SeptemberSome opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charterIncreasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicatedMisunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed  false pretenses. Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer systemAction on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meetingCouncil president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinanceAt the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effectiveNothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislationAt present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for dispositionLocal police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offensePlainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism. Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park HotelThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country ClubIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's ClubsHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retiredNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state. Sunday he had added ,  We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership. Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this? ? He askedThe former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican  and proud to have absorbed his philosophywhile working in his adminstrationMitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issueRegrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign, he said ,  because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign. The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remarkDumont spoke on the merit of having an open primaryHe then launched into what the issues should be in the campaignState aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industryDecries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate  Must share the blame for this. Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time, Mitchell saidJones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for MitchellHe said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways, Jones saidThe state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said ,  and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue. Defends Ike Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement :  I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. HughesHis reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world statureIt can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit. Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nominationSandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for JonesSandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent yearsSandman said :  The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveawayIt is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from WashingtonThat failed We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last yearThat , too , will fail. Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones CommitteeMrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewomanCounty Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use themThe proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a  lip service word. Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or chargeSheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county linesThe candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissionerSheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals My experience as public safety commissioner, Roos said ,  has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyerJim Sheeran fits that description.

Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge  to carry the issues to every corner of the state. He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn :  When I come back here after the November election you'll think , ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected '. He said ,  We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time. Attacks Republicans In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said ,  The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primaryBut we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platformWe'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November. He said ,  You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administrationBut I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead. He urged New Jersey to  become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy. He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean, the former Superior Court judge said To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s. Calling the Democrats the  party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people, Hughes asked ,  a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November. Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's  Green Acresplan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban developmentHe said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced MondayConservation plan The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the stateThe other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basisHughes said ,  This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it, pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950He said  Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve. Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involvedHe said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans After the primary, he promised ,  I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administrationI'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee. Trenton -- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleaguesThe outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee byThere may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican votersA special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committeeShe also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendmentShe served one four-year term on the national committeeResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running matesAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorableSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three yearsThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leadersSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the partyOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primaryThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the cityTheir view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as MayorIn an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leaderMayor visits Buckley As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leaderHe is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the partyLast night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situationApparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggleIn talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticketBut Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successorScrevane and Beame hailed The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for ControllerThe Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the BronxAfter his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York TimesThe Mayor said :  It didn't come from meBut as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates. Boston , June 16 -- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in MassachusettsThere is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politicsThe taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are  all the same.  It's ' See Joe , see Jim ', he says The hand is out. A political scientist writes of the growth of  alienated voters, who  believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular controlThese voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them. Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel ,  The Last Hurrah. But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subjectA succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last yearGraft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigationsAnd the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home stateA reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public lifeDay after day some new episode is reportedThe state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront propertyAn assistant attorney general is directed to investigateWashington , June 18 -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambersIn the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or oppositionIn the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education billThe housing bill is now in the House Rules CommitteeIt is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertainThe panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floorMr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back TuesdayLeadership is hopeful The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative RepublicansThe Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this weekThe $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income familiesIt also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitoriesThe education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversyThey are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of MassachusettsThree groups to meet What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematicsMr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor CommitteeAbout half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corpsIn the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agenciesTwelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interviewSix of these were proposed by religious groupsThey will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin AmericaQuestion raised Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goalsThere are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubledWhen he protested , the hotel owner said :  Why do you worry ? ? The U. S. Government is paying for itThe U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers. Missionary explains  I don't work for the Government, the American said I'm a missionary. The hotel owner shrugged Same thing, he saidAnd then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they canNo religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposesMoscow , June 18 -- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming :  Look , he took everything I had! !

Y. , June 18 -- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United NationsThis was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United NationsOne effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as IndiaIndia is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitantsThe new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed reportThe report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United NationsFormula is due this week The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this weekThe jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to startEach member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen postsEach member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off pointGeneva , June 18 -- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdomThe decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forcesThe latter two are half-brothersTheir joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of LaosAn agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats concededBut no one was overly optimisticTactics studied in Geneva W.

Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political futureThis is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross BarnettBarnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as wellConsequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming yearCould be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus farThe builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's officeThere are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scrambleCertainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful  honeymoonhe had in the 1960 legislative sessionIf Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special sessionThe odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the yearDistricts issue Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitatingBarnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressureThe issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seatWith eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the LegislatureMississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White HouseSplit badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreckAnd there has been no effort since the election to pull it back togetherFuture clouded Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionaryWith a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November electionNow , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their statusReports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmenBaton Rouge , La. -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stressesThe year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issueBut it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state governmentThe transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per centThe administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid programBut the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregationLegislators weary Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeatThe administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid programThe effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds voteThe tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenesDavis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcyIf it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integrationHe could terminate special sessions of the LegislatureActually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anywayMany legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integrationThis is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publiclyThey would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectualUnderlying concern Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transitionHe could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battleThen he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months periodIt is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another oneBut if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposesThis would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cashIt could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal yearIf the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemmaSince the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenuesConstant problem In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiserThe prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governorIt is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problemBut if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state LegislatureThis might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the yearA constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economizeAny tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselvesThe new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticismsCity Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside trackwith the cityEstimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000Shortcuts

S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated, Berger saidThe contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El trackThe contract called for overhauling of 102 jointsThe city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill chargedWide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each jointThe bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per jointBut , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per jointBerger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conferenceWagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company We won't know the full amount until we get a full report, Wagner said We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond, Berger saidWagner replied ,  Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172,000 '? ? ' know enough to sue ' Berger insisted that  we know enough to sue for the full amount. Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El We want to find out who knew about it, Pratt said Certain people must have known about it.

Cemal Gursel as presidentAn agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etatBy-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition governmentThe army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as presidentGen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 monthsThe military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardonedParty leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its ownVincent G.

M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday nightMartin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah HotelHe told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours, he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyaltyPatience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet UnionHe cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added ,  so long as people rebel , we must not give up. Martin called for patience on the part of Americans The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build, he saidBy leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he saidIndividual help best  We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient, the assistant secretary saidEconomically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselvesPrivate business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselvesThe United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a  social cost. Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one countryThe Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attackBut there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should followThe board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperatingChairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to goDr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would  be more fruitful, and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster, he said Nobody really expects to evacuateI think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in followingMrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they  please take a stand, said ,  We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children. Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars  might not be realistic and would not work. Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's programThe board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meetingIt was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be doneSalem ( AP ) -- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov.

Sexton and Theodore W. HeitschmidtA stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial ColiseumThe council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the BibleThe council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the BibleAt the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented ,  The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives. New point added Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the listThe first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads :  The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct. The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- His miracles -- His substitutionary work on the cross -- His bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of GodSuper again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of GodHis offices are in Springfield , Mo.Election came on the nominating ballotFriday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program ,  Breakthroughscheduled to fill the churches for the next two yearsIn his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with  Breakthroughthe theme for the first two yearsThe Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the churchThis means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life, he told delegates FridayChurch loses pace Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes , he said  our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge.  In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches, the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none, he saidTo step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 yearsTo accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said' church meets change '  The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour. A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches-- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers-- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project )-- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churchesU.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trialDenials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdictIn denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that  a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are. Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decideProof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied :  It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out. In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its caseMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantageSiebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hitsThen Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlockA two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight startsHouse throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned TuttleCatcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirtThen Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning runRookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into centerThe Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchersThree were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding oneHartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami StadiumThe Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourthHartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumphKeegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tallyRobinson doubles again In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into leftWhitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on ballsThen three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to producePete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of shortJohn Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contestThe Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plateThe Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were outJackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rallyLumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the errorThen Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runnersWhen Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy CareyThe detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right centerCarey Singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to firstIt was ruled a difficult chance and a hitThen Throneberry rapped into a fast double playBreeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left centerIf the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoonMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring trainingHansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 playersThe big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league  rookie-of-the-year, flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row15 pounds lighter The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last springHe hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks henceWhen he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 --  too light for me to be at my besthe said I feel good physically, Hansen added ,  but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now.

Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile runMrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , OhioSan Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital hereWaters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 seasonWhile working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physicianSt. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) -- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox todayAustin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three gamesTime stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the fieldAlthough he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of footballMoritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton BowlThat's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 triesHe ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington StateMoritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 teamBut ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response ,  place-kicker. A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kickingLast year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me, said Moritz So I started practicing on it in spring trainingMoritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enoughMoritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this weekHe kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school, he said ,  and made 26 in a row at one timeI never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years. Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injuryHe missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yardsHe went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years laterBut he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last seasonPlace kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to itI've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feelPractice helps you to get your timing down It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off. Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead, he explainedFootnotes : In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 triesTailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three gamesSaxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the benchWingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for OklahomaLast week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said :  That won't last long. It didn't ; ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top fourA good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice UniversityThe Mustangs don't play this week We're just real happy for the players, Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure onIt was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ). Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as  a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the playersWe needed it and we got it. Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy GannonBoth turned in top jobs for the second straight game Nelson played magnificent football, Meek praised He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of timesAnd he caused the fumble that set up our touchdownHe broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football. Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stagesOne was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it, Meek said He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn aroundHe really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss. The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards He just lay back there and waited for it, Meek said He almost brought it back all the way. Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game, Meek said He'll be out of action all this weekHe got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the gameThere is definitely some ligament damage in his knee. Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run, Meek explained We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play. The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday, Meek said ,  and probably will have a good scrimmage FridayWe'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off. SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21Huddle hearsay -- Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A & M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mudEnd Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injuryThe Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity SaturdayHalfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout MondayThe Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short oneThe Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckoningsBuffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren RabbRabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions Just our luck! ! Exclaimed Stram Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way. Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well, said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job. The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack, explained Stram They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble. The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them offThe principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfbackHe was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yardsThe Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for DallasA quick touchdown resulted That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away, said Stram , quipping ,  I think I'll put that play in the book. The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas , Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last weekTexas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC highArkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A & M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yardsTexas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 )A & M has the best defense

unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday nightSt. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field

AP ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball I've had it, he told a newsman I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club. This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkoutJensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 gamesHe took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaitedShe said , when she learned Jackie was heading home :  I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances. The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutesSports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with himThe conductor said to Ritchie :  I don't think you want to talk to himYou'll probably get a ball bat on the headHe's mad at the world. But Jackie had gone into the stationRitchie walked up to him at the magazine stand I told him who I was and he was quite coldBut he warmed up after a whileI told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyholeHe said he had never talked to Liston. Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying :  I can't hit anymoreI can't runI can't throwSuddenly my reflexes are goneJust when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to waggingAnd so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree SundayBoth , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastimeOf the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most heartsIt was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestoneAnd one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked ,  Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguerThe modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good daysBut there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's historyYes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et alSpahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the tradeI remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions, remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouseThe spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine inningsIncidentally , only two did it before a home audienceBobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts FieldEd Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the roadWillie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey MantleThis is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-YankeeThe record books , however , would favor the Giants' aceIn four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 basesOnce the figure was 30-30Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey'sThe Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's parkIt will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slumpThe Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at homeThis rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulersThe last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the  Living Room Athletic Clubwhen games were cut offActually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policyThis year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion hereThere are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will ariseIt is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league levelYou would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policyThis dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the gameCincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) -- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finaleWith Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series gameJohnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inningHector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourthThe Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errorsThe crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaudIn the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men onMomentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two outIn the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matterThe Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a managerOnly Bucky Harris , the  boy-managerof Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the featPhiladelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coachSkorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a yearHe succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last seasonThe appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie GauerWilliams is a defensive coachGauer works with the endsChoice was expected The selection had been expectedSkorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entryVan Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last WednesdayPhiladelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a playerWith Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passingIn the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerialsSkorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passingCoach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh SteelersAn injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 seasonHe began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y.He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coachFour years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay PackersThe Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959Skorich began his new job auspiciously todayAt a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championshipShaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a footballWith the announcement of a  special achievement awardto William A.

Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlesslyHis goal was to obtain a National League team for this cityThe departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the YankeesDespite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forwardWhen he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move hereWhen that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchiseThe Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expandFlushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman PaysonA big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C.

J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournamentsHorton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illnessThe principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of MissouriGolf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve monthsHe won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize moneyHe was heralded as  Sportsman of the Yearby Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the  Professional Athlete of the Year, a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok BeltBut he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shotA couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 holeIt made him humanAnd it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despairIf such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for allIt was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated ArnoldHe merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates allThe world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusherHe boomed a 280-yard driveThen the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distanceNo margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shotThe ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds sliceHe tried again and once more sliced out of boundsHe hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side It is possible that I over-corrected, he said ruefullyEach of the four wayward shots cost him two strokesSo he wound up with a dozen It was a nice round figure , that 12, he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbedFrom the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas openThe idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States OpenTheir secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gullyWillie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep countStickler for rules  How many is that , Jim? ? Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project Thirteen, said Long Jim Nae , man, said Willie ,  ye must be countin' the echoes. He had a 16Palmer's dozen were honestly earnedNor were there any rules to save himIf there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the bookThis knowledge has come in handy , tooHis first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairwayThe ball floated downstreamA spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lieArnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf associationJoe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream I knew it all along, confessed Arnold with a grin ,  but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there. For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo stringsYet he remains the fiercest of competitorsHe'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's rightThat's how he first won the Masters in 1958It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarderArnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into forceRuling from on high  I can remove the ball , can't I? ? Asked Palmer of an official No, said the official You must play it where it lies.  You're wrong, said Arnold , a man who knows the rules I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling. He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional oneThe golfing fathers ruled in his favorSo he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that strokeUntil a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffersBut after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been beforeA formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick todayOther items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendmentsThe owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other divisionHowever , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeksPete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out :  We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other. Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in datesIf the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat, Mauch said here the other day The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last yearThey have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz. Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world championsThe Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9Change in pitchersSolly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies SundayManager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignmentAfter Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday nightHarvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch StadiumBoyer is suffering from a stiff neckHaddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's gameMizell has won both of his startsNieman kept in lineupAfter a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineupThat means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants I have to stay with Nieman for a while, Hemus said Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be readyWith a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center.  Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good, Hemus said He should be getting back in the groove before longOur pitching is much better than it has shown. The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterdaySix Bucks overUntil the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting overDespite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each , Dick Stuart , Don Hoak and Bob SkinnerBill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feetPerhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runsFriend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good, Murtaugh said Virdon has been blasting the ballNo plunkers for him. Six Bucs overThe Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the seasonOn last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestoneIn 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1A year later they were 4-13Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four timesThe '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victoriesThe '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victoriesSince 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger teamThose Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13They honored the battling Billikens last nightSpeakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington ,  had more confidence in themselves than I did. The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom KiefferIn addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing, Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies ,  but what this team had was a little differentThe boys had a tremendous respect for each other's abilityThey knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talkWe'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right '. The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-DispatchKieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent playMankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victoryBenington said ,  I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day. Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skillsAfter the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said ,  Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me. Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the teamAs Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said ,  I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play. Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his awardBevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in timeWithin a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help BeningtonOn the clock given him was the inscription ,  For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61. Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future, Benington pointed out By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it. St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball gameLarry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal CityThe victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tieThe tie was against Southeast Missouri last FridayScherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a tripleSt. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget FieldThe game opened a busy week for WashingtonThe Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , SaturdayHappy hitting If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectationsAnd that's meant as a boost , not a knockMays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heightsTheir heights , that isMantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- WillieHis best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 basesNow , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaksLabor relations Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each monthThe truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatmentFor that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effortMantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibilityThe old man was almost too possessiveStengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New YorkWith the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielderStengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oatsInheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on MickeyThe Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could leadAnd what leadership a proud Mantle has given so farThe opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this yearWillie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin DarkNext to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennantRomantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F.

Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action. The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operatesSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unionsThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expenseSince the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman saidThose union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wagesThe spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the jobA thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount StreetsThe victim , Norman B.

Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meetingThe disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meetingCites discrepancies Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval I hate to have these things come up again and again, Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion These are the board's minutesI'll write what you tell me to. For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years agoIt was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of himThe Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetingsDr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do soState Senator Joseph A.

Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last monthWerner criticized Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan hereHe said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in DecemberEquipment should be in operation  almost immediately after the first snowfall, Mr. Schaefer saidThe Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for  halting snow operationson Tuesday night after the Sunday stormSent home for rest Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the weekWhat he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some restWork resumed Wednesday , he saidMr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be  strictly enforced. Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas  not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive. Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezesAnnapolis , Jan. 7 ( special ) -- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detentionThe victims were H.

BaracloughThe trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prisonFourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960sFuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behaviorHe promptly went to communist East GermanyThe magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks This is Russian money, said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's officeHe asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets Of highest valueThe fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlierBut just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George SymondsHe said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemyCourt cleared Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untoldThe British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improveSo in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hourAlmost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleetBritain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbedThe United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the SkipjackWith the machinery went a complete design for the hullThe Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded itNavy's future involved  Much of the navy's future depends upon her, an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research stationIt was there that the two accused civil servants were at work Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines, the statement went onThe atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp.Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy saidThe hull was also a result of almost a decade of workIt was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever builtReputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyersIt could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a monthIt was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoesThe navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture  of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future. Interested in detector The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testifiedRange was a vital detailDesigns of parts were soughtSix radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lidOddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrestedThe charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives  is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmityon the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District courtThe three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic lawsIn his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were  entirely innocent. ' had to know peddlers '  When they became members of the city police narcotics unit, Sokol said ,  they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racketThey , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers. Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were  aiming at the same criminals. This , he added , brought about  petty jealousiesand  petty personal grievances.  In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy, Sokol continued ,  these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal.

Kegham was in Detroit , en route to join his wife and children in CaliforniaEmory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race, board chairman Henry L. Bowden statedBut an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting NegroesThe statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions, the statement saidThe statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregationAn Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the lawsThe Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria ,  all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people. At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the stateEmory is affiliated with the Methodist ChurchSome church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregationUrged in 1954 The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation From its beginning, the trustees' statement said Friday ,  Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learningTeaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creedInsofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creedCorporate existence  On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education.

Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a periodBut he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally  regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past. He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing ,  and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave. Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the governmentHe also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was  modestin terms of the man's responsibilityThe conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract? ? Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. My feeling at the moment, he said ,  is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about himThe continued operation of this program depends on having his service. Harvey criticized Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club TuesdayA publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of  cripplingthe agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff I rather resent, she said ,  you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished thisI think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the peopleThe staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles.

Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play, he commentedBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop, he saidThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and WyomingThere have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries, Buchheister told the delegatesIn addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oilThe Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon SocietyMrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W.

Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret  Reichenberg project, which remained unknown to the Allies until after the warAbout 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warheadThe target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of EuropeThe success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flightSqueezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitudeAt 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled  release, and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the HeinkelTo the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h.It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile She flew beautifully, said Fiedler There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flowI had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip. Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselageHe managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfieldMoments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landedFiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missilesThe missiles were to be armed with an underwater bombPilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual shipsA crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied handsNow a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at SunnyvaleHis spare time is spent in soaring gliders It's so quiet, he said ,  so slow , serene -- and so challenging.

A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a  labor consultantand operator of a janitors' serviceBefore he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlumsGlimco a buddy Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) AllegrettiAnother hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier, Stein said But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll. Connection is sought Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and AlexThe federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultantUnder scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St.The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businessesLee a witness Among the witnesses were Ed J.

Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av.Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick PlaceStein's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' payStein estimated this amount at  about $1,500 or $1,600 a month. A $12,500 payment Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for  labor consultant workwith five unions which organized Leavitt's workersLeavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' unionGovernment attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about  five or six loanstotaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last yearAll of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to LeavittStein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to  meet the payrollat National Maintenance companyThe deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av.The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterdayThe reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of healthThe weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next weekA board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonationCurtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorneyFederal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000Lien payments involved Huff's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgagesHuff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay  the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living. Huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrativeHuff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgageCharge lists 3 checks The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the associationThe shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av.There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offenseLater , Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit cardAll bouncedWhen Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday , hotel officials called policeBonn , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced todayProbably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past weekFor many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendousIt was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sellInvestors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that manyIn fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 sharesSome Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customersA measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading beganThe stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a shareThe first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a shareAnd from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a shareBut the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the marketIndeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building upLetters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share )There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of TexasCable confirmation, it said translatedBut E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 sharesAfter it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyoneBut the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ', he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the countryHe was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can doBut what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? The answer is that it was a combination of circumstancesFirst , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds upAs a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend )Second , the  potato chip industryhas caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the marketBoth of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-upAnd third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a  growthindustry in the public mind of lateFoods , which long had been considered  recession resistantbut hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratiosThe potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by mergerThe history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression daysThose that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittestBut today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firmsSo they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like FritoAll those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and isNow , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up toDallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollarsMore than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at ShermanIt is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year historyThe exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollarsIt weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each yearA modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this areaThe Murray Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated in Dallas in 1896They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900'sMore than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grownMurray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firmThe Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala.Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala.About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employesThe company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing worldHardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipmentThe firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co.They export alsoThe company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill suppliesIn 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipmentPresently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the yearThe Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga.The district office here employs about 65The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters hereThe cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959Gordin manufacturing operations are in LubbockThe John E.

Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of AmericaSanta Barbara --  The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn, Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conferenceAnother speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more. He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the panbut the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantialhe said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960. Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence. Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth, he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery. Danger cited He cautioned that  the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation. The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it  even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958. The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strikeSacrifices needed Draper declared ,  As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us todayWe must justify our heritageWe must be ready for any needed sacrifice. He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration , that  Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must. He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war  you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do. While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro ,  for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphereIts the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that. New York ( AP ) -- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeksAnalysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for  support levelrepresented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial averageIt was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averagesSome good news Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good newsA substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last monthTreasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxesThe Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87Of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declinedNew highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14Trading was comparatively dull throughout the dayVolume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million MondayA $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American Marketing Assn.However , Peterson , president of Bell & Howell , warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and  unconventional wisdom. Creations needed  As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed, Peterson said With this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically. The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needsNothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideasHe cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technologyHe also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German marketElection of Howard L.

Washington ( UPI ) -- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads mergePerlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effectThe railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj All these kind of things weaken us, Perlman saidBad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s, he told the hearingC & O president Walter J.

This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing CenterOther reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were  resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify. Increase expected The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conferenceIt disclosed that the builders : Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing startsThe industry has said 1960 was a poor yearStarts were down 20 percent from 1959Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? Leaders of industry The reason , says the Housing Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference  are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders. Elburn , Ill. -- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales :  We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 moreWe sold only four pickers all last year. Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%, he saysThough the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areasParadoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm outputAlthough the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machinesFields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficientlyThe higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinerySeven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year, says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co.For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960Two of three report gains Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50%Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrendThe significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industryThe demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generallyFarmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of productsMore than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other productsFarmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale, says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 modelLast year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine. Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; in August of 1960 , he sold sevenDealers' stocks down With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturersFor example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reportsTractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice presidentWith the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implementsMerritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickersExcept for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machinesNearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospectsTotal farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospectsAgriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960Price support loans may total another $1 billion this yearWith cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record highNet income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-JulyKennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion rulingThe Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it minedThe company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished productsSuch  depletion allowances, in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assetsThe High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished productsA measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile productsThe measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alonePresident Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries, the President saidCharitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S.The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contributionRequests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a showIn such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit receivedA rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contestedA realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidationLouisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the saleThe corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax lawThe Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt incomeThe Tax Court rejected this viewIt said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidationsThe Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subjectThe Service has not said what its next step will bePeace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agencyIt provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year receivedThe owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and  kicked backto the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruledThe taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the managerThe Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these  kickbackswere not his income though they passed through his handsThe Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting :  It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction. A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vesselThe Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliancesHiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement incomeA spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverageShe would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-freeA frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement incomeIn that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the lawPossible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year madeState briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that areaColorado has a 2% sales taxDenver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area taxThe Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parentThe state's occupation tax is computed on gross salesThe court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entitiesWashington -- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reportedThe Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billionApril sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One )The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into MarchCommerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in MarchAdjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billionGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her professionAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this seasonShe will receive the 1961  Oscarat the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas HotelThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industryThe silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment CenterThe attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designsOccasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because  It's unlike me.

He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to AjAnd you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow lineWhat does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ?  Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat, says RamseySo he hides the mayonnaiseAnd to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condimentsWhat do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ?  Pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza, says the handsome food expert Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower.

I suggested My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois.  Did you? ? I was asked No, I said ,  I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois. I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdomI had to ride a streetcar two milesSometimes the streetcar was lateSometimes there weren't even any seatsI had to stand up , with the ladiesSometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day thereI've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and thenWhen they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big carShe has to have at least one car herselfI feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a womanEven that isn't satisfactoryIf they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big oneThey say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with themBut when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enoughThe logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myselfThe solution , naturally , is the busHowever , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legsMy wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from thereBut that's hardly realisticNobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an educationAdvance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last weekPublished annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postmanPublisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book  but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages.

Althaus , formerly of SwitzerlandHere's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp basesMost children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxesDisplayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accentTo create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shopMeasure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's headMake sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted  L, the foot of the  Labout three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the lightPulling strings Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp baseIn this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestalIf the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whimsAlthough a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtimeThose illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-roundThe scalloped edge is particularly appealingToday's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial eraA generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductionsIn the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touchSo junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the  hard knocks, while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show onlyThis isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland AldenHousewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had  an innate sense of the practical.

In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de balletIt seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip itThese qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personalityIt is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American balletOh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the KirovThis is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politicsBut , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concernedIrina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role beforeShe is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparableHit Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of NijinskyVladilen Semenov , a fine  danseur noble; ; Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificentThe production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right wayIt was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the sceneryEvegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unityMail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music SocietyThe season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber PlayersSustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; annual members may attend for $16Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle )Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut Street , San Francisco 9San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy childrenFire Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemenToys will not be collected at firehouses this yearThey will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association , at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16th Street and Roosevelt WayFrom the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distributionAny needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San Francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12Requests must be mailed in by December 5Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsalHe was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz MarinPresident Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said ,  We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests. For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in moviesAfter all , this year's movies are next year's television showsSo I went to see  La Dolce Vita. It has been billed as a towering monument to immoralityAll the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour filmIf that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fellAfter television ,  La Dolce Vitaseems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at nightI cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every weekI believe TV watchers will be bored La Dolce Vitahas none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV WesternWeek in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in  The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet. There is more decadence on  77 Sunset Strip. There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye seriesIn another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknownsWith the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge TheaterMost of the emphasis has been placed on a  wild partyat a seaside villaProducer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairiesPut them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dullApparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pallWhat a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! As A moral shocker it is a dudBut this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , filmThe Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly :  This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories.

He asked gloomily It is a British Austin , the smallest they make.  Get much mileage? ?  About 35. The gas station man sighed unhappily What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? Crunch , that's all she wrote.  I will die rich.  That will be $1.80, said the gas station man The windshield looks pretty clean. Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! !

S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishingsThe American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's libraryThe suite has been in the same family since the early 1800'sThe gift is being presented by  heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate ,  Tranquility, was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J.Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years agoThis acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairsThe AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential homeIt is the AID's intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of Americanabefore completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fallThe room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furnitureThe AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplaceIt will be painted to match the paneling in the roomThe AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the projectMrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J.

Barnes of BostonPresident Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C.But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the musicAt 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concertIt was the first in the series of  Concerts for Young People by Young Peopleto be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White HouseShe was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audienceShe is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing herAs he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the  Star Spangled Bannerand followed it with  Hail To The Chief.  I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them, President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian PfohlAfter paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said ,  As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music. He added  I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field. Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that  probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House. As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guestsHe expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston The nuns there do a wonderful work, the President commentedPatricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the DistrictEach of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbonThey enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staffMany of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audienceAnd it turned out to be more of a family affair than expectedHenry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the  Stars and Stripes Forever. Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last springHe said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the seriesA flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concertOne of the most interested  studentson the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy I was an art major in college, Miss Baldrige explained I've been here so many times I couldn't count them. She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of educationMiss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m.The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutesThe Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up laterThey decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look  sad; ; they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's  Alba Madonnaand  texturein a Monet painting of Rheims CathedralEverybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionistGallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to themHe pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery  is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard BalesI'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy '. Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guardsIn 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th CenturyA few of them said they  preferred contemporary art. Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra AngelicoThe thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain  because it's on the second floor. That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterdayMore than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogizedC. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic OrderThe ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the TempleA reception and tea followedAbout 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United StatesThe opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. todayThere will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m.A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington , one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in AlexandriaThe marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight yearsJohn had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonousHe would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wifeHurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the familyShe accused him of ignoring herHe in turn told her she demanded too muchThey were both discouraged , disgusted and miserableMary decided she had had enoughWithout any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be doneThe judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyerFamily Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington areaThey offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problemsBecause neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest themFor nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorceThe interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the otherThey are now working together toward solving their difficultiesJohn received a promotion in his firmHe gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on lifeMary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housingTo outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a differenceThey know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy familyFamily Service has helped hundreds of families in this areaPerhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vitalBut to the families it serves , their help cannot be measuredFamily Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers FundAnticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of hazeFor crucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier KhrushchevMr. Kennedy replied :  I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground. The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirableBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meetingHe wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policyLast Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relationsThe heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leaderHe was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were plannedBut Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastropheThat objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meetingDespite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold warRoad to Vienna The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace  at the summit of the nations. The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the  spirit of Geneva. The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle EastIn 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S.That meeting produced the  spirit of Camp David-- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlementOn the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory  spirit. Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incidentThe episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitryPre-inaugural position Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problemShortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words :  As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations. The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balanceHe did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessaryHe wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulatingAbove all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstepAttitude flexible At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leaderIdeally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levelsBut Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with itIt would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own viewsMoreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensionsBoth elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in FebruaryThe letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issuesBut it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permittedDevelopments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timingThere were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarminglyDeadlock on tests The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at GenevaThe deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machineryIn the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testingMr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmamentThere was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist ChinaThe question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgentMoreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for LaosMr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossibleDevelopments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meetingInitially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meetingAt the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressureIn Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstepIn Laos , the picture was almost equally badU. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be  neutralizedon Soviet termsBeyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forcesAs a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressureIn the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himselfAmbassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressiveHe has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is outThe President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning backIt was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near futureMr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the AlliesThe response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorableFirm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last weekApparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the  informalnature of the meetingThe Washington announcement said :  The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countriesThe meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries. The outlook The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is  shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident, and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacyThe announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapprovalThe approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at ViennaThe inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiationsBut those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutaryMr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of menThe feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pauseApart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summitPremier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anywayThis time the initiative came , in part at least , from WashingtonOther allies consulted There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leadersThus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunityFinally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accordThere is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the worldIf tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet UnionDisapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worseAfter Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holdsMoreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitmentsThe question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle EastThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactoryMollusks are a case in pointThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future developmentThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher educationThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universitiesThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at thatBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existenceThere is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering pictureViewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to universityBut the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policyOfficial encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial fundsAmerican Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learningThey have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been madeDiocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibilityAll of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwiseYet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communitiesCommunity esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possibleTo understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious communityIt is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachmentA religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhereThe fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimensionThe net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardshipAmerican Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of  private enterprise-- the  private enterpriseof religious communitiesHad it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employeesThere is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the  family business. This  family-communityspirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievementIt is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areasI think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educationalThis is not an isolated example ; ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enoughIt would seem to represent esprit de corps run riotApart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the  family businessspirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutinyFor while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its  pursuit of excellence. At the earlier  pre-academic excellencestage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basisBut with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for  outsidersbecomes more pressingThe problem is not merely that more  outside teachersare needed but that a different brand is called forCommenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term  teacher-employee( as opposed to , e.g. ,  maintenance employee) was a not inapt descriptionToday however , the  outsideris likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state universityAnd while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievementIn the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it :  Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilitiesIt is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence '. The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by  the organization which actually ownsit , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished  outsidefacultyIt is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to  the organization which actually owns the university: this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tensionBut in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one Outsidefaculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family businessThere are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic universityIn the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnelWord spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferencesExpressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotypeIn the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhereTo appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil ServiceMuch has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenureThis is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggeratedWhen a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his servicesA man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the  family. Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutionsAdequate compensation is indispensableYet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first placeBroadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the universityReligious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identificationThere is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levelsThe college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institutionBut this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participationThe second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the  in-groupthat owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itselfThis is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenureYet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in orderThe first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authorityIn the case of academic personnel the  feelingof participation can hardly be  faked. Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisionsThose who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by  busy-workand ersatz decision makingIn any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at allIn the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to  luncheon-table communication. In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of  participation: the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangementsSen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly lawsOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equallyOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges. The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sitesThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile programIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the billIt is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strikeBusiness Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operatingThe company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workersThe company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's businessRep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services CommitteeThe committee remains unresponsiveNeither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unionsThe recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtainedThe anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; it must play a game in which there never is a winnerThe fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the lawHypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policyLet us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the marketThe industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is appliedThe problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipmentAccounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any priceNaturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short timeShould these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industryUncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by  unfair competition. But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the ordersUnder the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convictedEngaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giantsThe paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellowsIn other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and SaturdayAnd which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? The question might be asked :  Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws? ? The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937He wrote :  ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than controlIn this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government. This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth whileA plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities) If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interestA secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicleHowever , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rationalQuite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor unionThose who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reformBefore 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain EnglishThe acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principleThe Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargainingThe basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competitionIf a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraudThe tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal professionThe problem must be faced squarelyIf laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon themHuman labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century AmericaAs early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations :  We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; but many against combining to raise it. Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiraciesIn 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared :  It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies. There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopolyThe courts shared the opinion of the employersIn People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared :  Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means. Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor  if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment. Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportationHis bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same internationalParadoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust actIndeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergersAt the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight ratesThe passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopoliesIt was most effective against trade unionsIn the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturerThe suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgmentIn 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodityThe law could not suspend economicsLabor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust lawsThe courts , by interpretation , emasculated the actIn 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal CompanyThe company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? ) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerceThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroadAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmenWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review. That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three frontsWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions1 ) CubaHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees )President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure, said the President That limit has now been reached. Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decisionKennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declinedHe thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere )2 ) LaosAfter a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam In view of the present situation in Laos, said the Pentagon's announcement ,  we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific. Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marinesOn the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signalBut by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for LaosFrench & IndiansThere was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war frontsPolitical , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again, said one military manBut why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and LaosThe late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the WestHe began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj The important thing from now on, he said ,  is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia. Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and timeSoviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in replyConsidering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; but , in Senator Gore's words , it was  not a very encouragingsituation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration DayThe Congress turmoil in the House As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floorThe liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lostThis time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorableThey had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneckAnd counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their willDeadly deadlockThere were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer )Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godlinessA dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservativeHe is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituentsHe is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an  anti-NegrospeechFor 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules CommitteeThere his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes )Equal treatmentThere was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in MississippiReprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sonsIn 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against PowellSaid he :  We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here. ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effectiveIn a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican )Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebelsThe next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as  an inferior man. News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked outWhen Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple Unconscionable! ! He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object :  A dangerous precedent! ! Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projectsSitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services CommitteeThreat of warAs the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could loseHis highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucusThe liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? ) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplashBut in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier warIf the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable partyWith that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone, said a House Democratic leader One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any. Battle in the senate The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speechQuestion at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights billsNew Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirdsFair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of SenatorsGeorgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joinedPrivately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passagePrivately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard NixonIn 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not bindingArmed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this weekHopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for allRepublicans last act Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public viewBut with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's InaugurationOne day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make  sufficient declarationof the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential electionNixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required  sufficient declaration.  This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated, he saidThe Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nervesGary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lapArnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you, Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournamentAnd that is just what happened on the last few holesThe Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and PalmerPlayer was the first to feel its teethAfter playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to piecesHe bogeyed the 10thAfter a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13thHe bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tearsHe could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a strokePalmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokesNow all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golfWhen Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship wonBut the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depressionIn trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV towerAfterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fastHe did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lostWhen the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feetPalmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the puttPalmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with CoeThe lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69End at seven Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first placeAs evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter longBut Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be brokenHalf an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of PalmerMore than a streak had endedLong after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary PlayerUnlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the caseWhen the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestigeAs if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournamentsPlayer won only oneBut as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhereOn the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to comeOn that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won itBut whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tourPlayer immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of PalmerHe outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at MiamiWhen they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to dateInstant rivalry On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantlyIt was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National courseThe usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequencesPalmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob RosburgBut Player was only one stroke back , with a 69Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and PlayerA lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe) On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focusRosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good dayAs Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contenderPlayer began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9thOn the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournamentHe birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumphAt one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final holeWithout so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in replyThe boldness of champions Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf courseIt is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violenceThe bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these championsBob Jones played that wayByron Nelson did , Hogan didAnd last week at the Masters Palmer and Player didAs the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the leadThis day Palmer had started firstAs Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the dayPlayer immediately proceeded to follow suitIn fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holesBut Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yardsHe hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairwaysHaving hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards outPlayer then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gamblingThe latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green I was hitting the ball well, Player said later ,  and I felt strongWhen you're playing like that you'd better attack. Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forgetIt struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edgeFrom there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troublesThey started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few daysAt the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the greenHis bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even parStarting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew itWhen Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublimeWhen Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits aweBut when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained ,  the other team thought no one was out there, hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculousThis is Baseball 1961This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculousIt is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitterPitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegalExperts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansionWhatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run divisionOf all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardyThis , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the YankeesSince 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwartedWhat ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surgeIn the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matchedDouble threat : Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bidBut now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is realAfter 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runsAfter 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runsThis is the great edge the two Yankees have going for themTo better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourishAll Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new recordIn Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 gamesBaseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games)  Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation, insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox It has to be easier with two of themHow can you walk Maris to get to Mantle? ? Roommates : Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himselfAlthough both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote :  The important thing is to win the pennant. But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs (  I hope Roger hits 80, Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs (  and I hope I hit 81)The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming togetherMantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International AirportThe three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furnitureMantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living roomThey divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee StadiumMantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for MarisAs roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgroundsBoth were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma (  Sometimes in the minors, Maris recalls ,  I wished I had gone to Oklahoma)To an extent , the two even look alikeBoth have blue eyes and short blond hairBoth are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks biggerWith their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to orderMaris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New YorkMantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 eachLight reading : Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's  Tropic of Cancer. Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road tripsMantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking What do you and Mickey talk about at home? ? A reporter asked Maris recently To tell you the truth, Maris said ,  Mickey don't talk much. This is no surprising trait for a ballplayerWhat is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperativeOf the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspokenBut last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote See that kid? ? He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy That's ( Yogi ) Berra'sI'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the gameI came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk '. Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen When I've made a dumb play, he says ,  I don't want to talk to anyoneI'm angry. By his own confession , Maris is an angry young manBenched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer :  I can't play for youSend me where I can play. ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa.) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell :  I'm not learning anything on the benchPlay me. ( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series)  That's the way I am, he says I tell people what I thinkIf you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get madGive me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times. Idols' idols : One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroesMaris's was Ted Williams When I was a kid, Maris told a sportswriter last week ,  I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not.  When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice? ?  Are you kidding? ? Said Maris You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize. Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio When Mickey went to the Yankees, says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver ,  DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of hisBut DiMaggio never said a wordIt crushed MickeyHe told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him. Mantle has kept the vowAmong all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookiesNeither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all elseIf laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad trackIf working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mineBut since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseballThey try to play baseball the best they canEach is a complete ballplayerMantle , beyond any question , can do more things well(  One of the reasons they get along fine, says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men ,  is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris. ) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handedThey both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swingsMantle is considerably better hitting for average ( , fourth in the league , to for Maris so far this year )Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first baseBoth have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White SoxBoth are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; Maris's throwing arm is strongerYet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home runWith this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teamsOnly two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first placeAppropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest momentIn 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseballSomething was needed to revive interest ; ; the something was the home runInto Washington on President-elect John F.

One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because  I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future. Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed :  I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face. G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of PittsburghThere the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting artLast week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pauseOn display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for saleLike Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetimeHe made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boomEven before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintingsHe gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the bestHe was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him :  I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about. He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greetingHe could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was toughHe bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculpturesHe gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the worldAll these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see themTwo years ago Thompson offered his collection to the cityBut he insisted that it be housed in a special museumPittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for yearsHe went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading picturesLast year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be builtLast week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the blockAt the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last timeIn fact he seemed delighted to get rid of themSome observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home townThompson himself said :  I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures. Break in Georgia The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or colorBut in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classroomsLast week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a  qualifiedNegro boy and girlTheir entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as wellFor 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the universityThey graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne thirdThe university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skinsHolmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfbackCharlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State UniversityLast fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply againCharlayne was  tentativelyadmitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne StateBut Holmes was rejected again  on the basis of his record and interview. The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversationHolmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a  beatnik parlor or teahouse. No , said he , but officials still called him  evasive. They also said he lied in saying that he had never been  arrested. Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspendedNegro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton HolmesThe real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated schoolJudge Bootle's decision :  The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color. The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university Surprised and pleased, Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this weekCatch for Chicago When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the MidwayOut went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestionsSuch academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consultedTwo committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge BundyThe debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it ,  a top scholar in his own right-- a bright light to lure other top scholars to ChicagoLast week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 )It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard HutchinsHe threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 millionBut though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins eraAt Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-makingBeadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never endBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass awayThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still goodBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central AfricaThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unityIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walkingThe population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major  culture clustersand innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialectsThe religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animismThe climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperateThe hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports carsTo make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private propertyBut by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscienceThe Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialismOne definition of paternalism is  The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children. The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgmentOrdinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infantThe Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oilThe colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any voteThe beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stockIn Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as  the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner. Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassionBut they were notThey provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; they put much effort into public housingThey also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate foodBut instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more oftenWould not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? The Belgians also placed great emphasis on educationDuring the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the CongoBut almost all the schools were primaryThe average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of  la chatteand  le chienand write his nameSome schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained manyBut they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in collegeIt was their conviction that the people should be  brought up together, a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political scienceIndeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrestWhen the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduatesWhy did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping AfricaThey lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their coloniesThe Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; and in Brussels , street crowds shouted ,  Pas une goutte de sang ! !( Not one drop of blood ! ! )The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the messIt is hard to blame them for thisYet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltlessAs the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduateThere were four principal onesFirst , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing itSecond , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the statesThird , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central governmentAnd fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew upHowever , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shiftingA final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administrationThey had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupingsThus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for warThe Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provincesWell-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nationsIf internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white BelgiansThe president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable manTwenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each otherPresently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and lootingTerror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the countryThe Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the CongoOn July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the countryConfusion became chaos ; ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violenceLumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust themOn July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the CongoVague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General  to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks .Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or FranceHe quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hoursUltimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whitesIt took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the CongoThe Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. effortsThe wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a CommunistBefore appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small  warswith the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as wellMeanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his  wars, dispatching  techniciansand even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openlyBut by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the CongoPresident Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired himLumumba fired KasavubuControl of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese armyMobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New YorkThe Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troopsBut they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called  volunteersor  mercenaries, who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire countryFrom October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little actionThere was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize itDuring the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the CongoIn February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to actionOn Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of  all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort. Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier oneIt also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the armyThe presidency : talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last weekHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of BizerteOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglioIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo anteon Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean baseTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekendThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. supportThe conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilableThrough Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said :  The key question now is which side picks up the phone first. On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend )Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for ProgressAnd that was not allIn conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United NationsChen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a voteThe President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aidTo Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory CoastAll week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared :  We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason. Crime : ' skyjacked ' From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San AntonioWhen Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longerThe plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in PhoenixThirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboardAt 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach, Berry said I figured he was sick. John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army, he said The other fellow had a. Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. RickardsTo Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at ArequipaBut last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to HavanaStalling :  Tell your company there are four of us here with guns, the elder man told RickardsThe pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that messageBut , he told the  skyjackers, the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; they would have to refuel at El PasoMost passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the groundJerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba, McCauley said ,  and like a nut I raised my handI thought he was the Air Force recruiter. What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crewThey chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. AugustineFla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border PatrolEverybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m.They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine gunsOther FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to HavanaThe ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hoursStill more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas AjActually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephoneAt one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with CubaAs the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartmentFrom the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school juniorTension The heat and strain began to tell on the BeardensThe father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said ,  we mean business, took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman SimmonsAt 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : Take off or see the hostages killedThe tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runwaySeveral police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jetThe slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; the plane slowed to a haltAmbulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded itThe day wore onAt 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the planeA few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmedWhile Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear doorSo did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and MullenThat left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the BeardensThe elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocketGilman started talking to him until he saw his chanceHe caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and --  I swung my right as hard as I couldSimmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over. Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said :  I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs. Congress : more muscle Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nationThe Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. historyWith the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000The  hold-back, as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudentlyIn all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short orderIn other areas , Congressional action last week included : The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappilyThe Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activitiesDebate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekendWhite House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intactFood : stew a la Mulligatawny Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they canBut , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voterAs a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve itOver the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American courseIndividual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from FloridaBut plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right placeIn a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotelHolders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikesLong-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upwardHigher toll rates also are helping boost revenuesResult is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculativeThings are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bondsTraffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growingThat added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gatesAs a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investmentsAnother result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bondsOther tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's averageOn balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since thenHowever , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trendOn these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declinesTax-free returnsInvestors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bondsYou find the evidence of that in the chart on this pageMany of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to thatAnd this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bondsThat 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bondsIt's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bondsFor investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is highIt is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed incomeSwelling trafficA new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happeningThe report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankersNearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the periodAnd there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recessionMany of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winterIndication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upwardLook , for example , at the Ohio TurnpikeTraffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costsAs a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bondsThat was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 monthsThat same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts TurnpikeOperating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in MarchCosts were held down , despite a bitter winterFor the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding periodThe road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into BostonSlow successesSome turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can doThe 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reservesIn the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interestThat improvement is continuingIn the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960Success , for many turnpikes , has come hardTraffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimatesIn these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highwaysMany rate increases already have been put into effectHigher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under studyEasier accessProgress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikesThe Kansas Turnpike offers an illustrationNet earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo.Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more yearsFor some roads , troublesInvestors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goalsTraffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alikeIf nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the sameThese , however , are exceptionsThe typical picture at this time is one of steady improvementIt's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in fullAlready , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable marginsMany others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even pointA top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a  very serious situationcompetitivelyCommerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machinesOur staff man cabled from Turin as follows --  Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this :  One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a dayAbout half of these are exported Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costsA skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week Three , labor troubles are infrequentFiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face Olivetti had a special interest for HodgesOlivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashedThe result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machineryThe firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S.The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S.There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas '. Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive importsThe recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many linesImportant aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President KennedyChief aims of the proposed conference are worth notingThe U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the yearsPoint is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feetIf they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise wouldIdea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possibleAt the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countriesJapan , since 1957 , has been  voluntarilycurbing exports of textiles to the U.S.Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the  Lancashire Pact. None of these countries is happy with these arrangementsThe Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. marketHong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedlyThe Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasonsThe Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that  dumpingpractices cause friction all around and may result in import quotasGradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wantsThis may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other productsIt's an important clue to Washington thinkingNote , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry Get competitive or get out. In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industryThe Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasibleSpecial depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowedGovernment research will look into new products and methodsImport quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involvedBut the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotasRather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other productsWhat's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countriesAmong the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal minersYet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths waterSteel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign marketsVirginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby minesU.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freightMany of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deepProductivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the BritishWelsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coalThey threaten to strikeThe British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal inThe British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sellEvery library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically ,  I'm sorry , but we don't have that bookThere wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid. Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallestWhat to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequateA startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest cityThe plight of a small community library is proportionately worseConfronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual fundsIn some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basisNew York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to followBecause it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan worksAt one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated areaAt the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serveBoth these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the stateIt was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of todayUnder this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amountsAn earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fitSome library boards are wary of the planA large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too greatA small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the boardWithin a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preservedThe local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a systemAll services are given without cost to membersSo obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-opTo set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around itThe collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collectionEach system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiencyThe basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollarsIn Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operationThe Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan areaThe need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could affordNassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centersBasic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local librariesOn microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicalsThe entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loansHeadquarters gets about 100 requests every dayIt is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provideThe books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other librariesEach subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build uponEast Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languagesThe reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference serviceThis kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of coursePublic libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basisLocal libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual libraryThe system passes on these savings to its membersFurther money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billingBooks are not the only resource of the systemSchools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communitiesThe most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without chargeThis catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as  Nanook Of The North,  The Emperor's Nightingale, and  The Red Balloon. Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library serviceThe system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visitsHeadquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selectionSample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groupsStory hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultantHeadquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundariesIn addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member librariesThe system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membershipIn Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in generalLibrarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results todayLibrary use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agersTo them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say ,  I'm sorry , we don't have that book. Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concernedThe great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western worldThe need for lifetime reading is apparentEducation must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our societyThe desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural lifeWe cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; if we do not know how to use what we do readWe must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written wordA fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our librariesAlthough progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed AmericaThe problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expandThe inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this conditionThere are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate serviceIn college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of EducationAnd over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at allIn every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed servicesOnly public understanding and support can provide that serviceThis is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme :  For a richer , fuller life , read! !\""
